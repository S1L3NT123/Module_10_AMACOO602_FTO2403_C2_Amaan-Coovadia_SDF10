## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

An API (application programming interface) uses a set of protocols (rules) to allow for communication between software. It allows for software to communicate and share data. While I have not used an API in any projects my group and couch have used it to create an application to display the weather.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API?

[Your answer goes here]

An API allows for applications to communicate with each other think of it like a road that connects two towns. An interface allows a person to interact with an application

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

The main components of an API are:
Endpoints: The URLs or URIs that represent resources or actions provided by the API. Endpoints serve as entry points for interacting with the API's functionality.
Request methods: Are the actions performed on the endpoints (post,get,put,...)
Parameters: Are the extra information can be used in API requests to customize the behavior or filter the results.
Response data: The data returned by an API.
The type of API i find most intriguing is RESTful APIs. Their simplicity allows developers to design intuitive and efficient APIs and they have widespread adoption.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs?

I personaly have not used any APIs in any projects so far, but my coach and group have made a weather appliction using an API to get realtime data. We did not use any specific tools.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I feel confident im my understanding of APIs, however I am severly lacking in practical experience. I will be trying to enhance my skills by doing more practice using APIs like trying to rebuild the weather application we have made.
